# Snake Game

## Have been learning rust since a while now. Wanted to test my knowledge with something small and what better than the snake game. It isnt much but it's honest work. To run the game yourself follow the below instructions

## Install rust first(Mac or Linux)

`curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`

## It is in the AUR if you find yourself on arch linux

```
git clone https://github.com/viraj-s15/snake-game.git
cd snake-game
cargo build
cargo run
```
